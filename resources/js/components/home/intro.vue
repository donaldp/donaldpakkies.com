              Just a random 21 year old who is trying to build cool sh*t. I'm a very innovative Software
              Engineer who spent his entire childhood writing code. I like coming up with new things (like building
              a new Programming Language or creating a Web Framework) and learning new stacks.

              I'm a Open Source contributor and an advocate for good quality Software. If i tell you "i don't like
              your code", It's probably because i think you can improve :).
